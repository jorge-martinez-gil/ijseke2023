# A Comparative Study of Ensemble Techniques Based on Genetic Programming: A Case Study in Semantic Similarity Assessment
Semantic similarity assessment is an important task in NLP, which aims to measure the degree of similarity between two pieces of text. There are various techniques that have been developed to solve this problem, including our ensemble techniques based on genetic programming. We present a comparative study of different ensemble techniques based on genetic programming for semantic similarity assessment.
